Pulser
======

Pulser is a simple organized pulse generator designed to replace trigger-sync in the 2p.  It's not very far yet, but I'm already forking it so I thought I'd throw it up.

Use:
Configure aquisition paramaters in the pulser_startPulser function and run.

Soon:
Configuration files and GUI along with more functions.
