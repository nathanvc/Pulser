Pulser
======

Pulser is a simple organized pulse generator designed to replace trigger-sync in the 2p.  It is only compatible with Matlab2012b and requires the DAQToolBox.  Analog and Digital I/O are supported on 32 or 64-bit windows thanks to improvments in the toolbox.  There is a fully-functional, but not user friendly version available that does not use the daqtool box, email me or check the GIT repository for more info.
